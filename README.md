#ðŸ“¦ graph_rag_llama_index_aws_bedrock
A modular framework for building Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using LlamaIndex and AWS Bedrock.

This repository provides an end-to-end implementation of a scalable RAG pipeline that leverages graph-based data structures for enhanced context retrieval. It integrates:

LlamaIndex for constructing and querying knowledge graphs.
AWS Bedrock for accessing foundation models like Claude, Titan, and others.
Graph-based retrieval to improve semantic search and contextual relevance.
Modular architecture for easy customization and deployment.
ðŸ”§ Features:

Graph construction from documents, APIs, or databases.
Query routing and optimization using graph traversal.
Integration with Bedrock-hosted LLMs for inference.
Support for multi-modal and multi-source data ingestion.
Example notebooks and deployment scripts.
ðŸš€ Ideal for:

Enterprise search
Knowledge management
Intelligent assistants
Research and academic applications
